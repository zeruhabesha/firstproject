      <span className="absolute top-134 left-156 text-white font-inter font-regular text-xs v1_8">Coffee is one of the most popular and widely consumed beverages in the world, but its origins are shrouded in mystery and legend. Oromo people of East Africa have been familiar with the coffee plant and its properties for centuries. The Oromo are one of the largest and most ancient ethnic groups in Africa, with a rich and diverse culture and history. The Oromia region is considered the birthplace of coffee, as it is home to the wild coffee plants that are the ancestors of all cultivated coffee varieties today.</span>

      <span className="absolute top-406 left-74 text-white font-inter font-regular text-xs v1_13">The Oromo people have a deep and sacred connection with coffee. For them, coffee is more than a beverage: it is a way of life, a source of trade, a tool for peace-keeping, and a spiritual nourishment. The Oromo people also have a unique and elaborate ceremony of preparing and serving coffee, which is called buna qalaa. This ceremony is a social and cultural event that involves the whole community, and is usually performed by women. The ceremony consists of several steps, such as roasting the green coffee beans in a pan over a fire, grinding the roasted beans with a mortar and pestle, boiling the ground coffee in a clay pot called a jebena, and pouring the coffee into small cups called finjal. The coffee is served in three rounds, each with a different name and meaning. The first round is called abol, which means "birth", and represents the beginning of life. The second round is called tona, which means "growth", and represents the development of life. The third round is called baraka, which means "blessing", and represents the fulfillment of life. The coffee is usually accompanied by snacks, such as popcorn, bread, or roasted grains, and by incense, which is burned to create a pleasant aroma. The coffee ceremony is a time for socializing, sharing stories, resolving conflicts, and expressing gratitude.</span>
